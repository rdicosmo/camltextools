This is an OCaml re-implementation of the texexpand and delatex utilities
that were commonplace in the late 1990's on all TeX/LaTeX user machines.

The current version provides various enhanced features (like automatic
inclusion of the bibliography, and a mechanism to produce a self-contained
source file that can be broken again into parts using the -b option).
